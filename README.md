# A.T.T.I.C.

A Teensy Textventure/IF Creator, written from scratch in Java. As most of these things, it was written out of curiosity (10 years ago! :O) and is thus not very powerful or complex. Still, perhaps it's fun to someone to tinker with or build on as an exercise.

I tried to provide a complete documentation and included the sample game it's named after, [The Attic](https://crabman.itch.io/the-attic), so check it out if you want to see it in action. Digging up the code and fixing it up a bit has certainly given me a bit of a taste for it again, so perhaps I'll play around with it and expand it a bit in the future.

Have fun!
